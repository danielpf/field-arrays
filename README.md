Description
-----------
This repository contains functions for management of large arrays of values in C.
It can be used to perform unary operations such as allocation, initialization with R^n functions or fixed values as well as binary operations such as point-wise addition, multiplication, etc.
It was part of a larger project but was never used, although it was tested.
